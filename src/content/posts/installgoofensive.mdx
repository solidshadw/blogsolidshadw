Setting up a penetration testing environment can be tedious. You need to install Go, configure your PATH, and then manually install dozens of security tools one by one. This process is repetitive, error-prone, and time-consuming. That's why I created **InstallGoOffensive** - a bash script that automates the entire setup process.

## What InstallGoOffensive Does

InstallGoOffensive is a comprehensive bash script that:

### 1. Installs Go Automatically

- **Architecture Detection**: Automatically detects your system architecture (AMD64 or ARM64)
- **Latest Version**: Always installs the latest stable version of Go from the official website
- **PATH Configuration**: Automatically adds Go to your PATH by updating `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
- **Idempotent**: Can be run multiple times without breaking or duplicating installations

### 2. Installs 20+ Security Tools

The script installs a curated collection of essential offensive security tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **nuclei** | Fast and customizable vulnerability scanner |
| **subfinder** | Subdomain discovery tool |
| **naabu** | Fast port scanner |
| **gowitness** | Web screenshot utility |
| **httpx** | HTTP toolkit for probing web servers |
| **notify** | Notification utility for workflows |
| **assetfinder** | Find domains and subdomains related to a given domain |
| **waybackurls** | Fetch URLs from the Wayback Machine |
| **gf** | Wrapper around grep for pattern matching |
| **shortscan** | Security scanner for cloud services |
| **anew** | Tool for adding lines to a file only if they don't already exist |
| **simplehttpserver** | Simple HTTP server |
| **ffuf** | Fast web fuzzer |
| **amass** | Network mapping of attack surfaces and external asset discovery |
| **cloudrecon** | Cloud infrastructure reconnaissance tool |
| **gau** | Get All URLs |
| **gospider** | Fast web spider |
| **kerbrute** | Kerberos bruteforce utility |
| **aws-enumerator** | AWS enumeration tool |
| **gron** | Make JSON greppable |
| **qsreplace** | Query string replacement utility |

### 3. Smart Installation Strategy

- **Dual Location**: Installs tools to both `$HOME/go/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`
- **System-Wide Access**: Tools are available system-wide, not just for your user
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback on which tools succeeded and which failed
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically installs required build dependencies

## Key Features

### Cross-Platform Support

The script supports multiple Linux distributions:

- **Debian-based**: Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Parrot OS, etc.
- **Arch-based**: Arch Linux, BlackArch, etc.

It automatically detects your distribution and installs the appropriate dependencies:

- For Debian: `build-essential`, `libpcap-dev`
- For Arch: `base-devel`

### Architecture-Aware

Whether you're on an Intel/AMD system (AMD64) or an Apple Silicon/M1/M2 system (ARM64), the script detects your architecture and downloads the correct Go binary.

### Easy to Customize

You can easily add more tools by adding lines to the script:

```bash
install_go_tool "tool_name" "github.com/author/repo" "binary_name"
```

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solidshadw/installgoofensive.git
cd installgoofensive
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x install-tool.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./install-tool.sh
```

The script will:
- Detect your OS and architecture
- Install Go (if not already installed)
- Configure your PATH
- Install all 20+ security tools
- Provide a summary of successful/failed installations

### Post-Installation

After running the script, restart your shell or source your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc if using zsh
```

You can then use any of the installed tools directly:

```bash
nuclei -version
subfinder -version
ffuf -V
amass -version
```

## GitHub Repository

The script is open source and available on GitHub:

🔗 **[github.com/solidshadw/installgoofensive](https://github.com/solidshadw/installgoofensive)**

You can fork it, customize the tool list, and contribute improvements. It's designed to be modular - add or remove tools as needed for your workflow.

*Automate the setup, focus on the hacking.*
