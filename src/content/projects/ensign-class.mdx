Built a complete cybersecurity training environment for Ensign IT class using infrastructure-as-code principles. The environment provides students with hands-on experience in Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows, threat detection, and incident response.

## Infrastructure Overview

The lab environment is fully automated using **Terraform** to provision and manage virtual machines on **Proxmox**. This infrastructure-as-code approach ensures consistent, reproducible environments that can be quickly deployed or destroyed.

## Key Components

### Proxmox Hypervisor
- Base virtualization platform for hosting all lab VMs
- Enables resource isolation and efficient resource management
- Supports rapid provisioning and scaling of student environments
- Required for running the Terraform automation

### Terraform Automation
- Infrastructure-as-code for automated provisioning
- Version-controlled infrastructure definitions
- Consistent environment deployment across multiple students

### MITRE Caldera
- Adversary emulation platform for red team exercises
- Simulates real-world attack scenarios
- Allows students to practice detection and response techniques

### Wazuh SIEM
- Open-source Security Information and Event Management platform
- Real-time log analysis and threat detection
- Provides students with hands-on SIEM experience
- Security monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Wazuh agents installed on vulnerable VMs for centralized monitoring

### Vulnerable Active Directory Environment([GOAD](https://orange-cyberdefense.github.io/GOAD/labs/GOAD-Light/))
- Vulnerable Windows environment for hands-on training
- Based on the **GOAD (Game of Active Directory)** project, which provides a vulnerable Active Directory lab
- Students practice real-world AD attacks and defensive monitoring
- Includes common misconfigurations for adversary simulation
- Used for teaching lateral movement, privilege escalation, and domain persistence
- Pre-configured with security vulnerabilities for testing
- Integrated with Wazuh agents for SIEM monitoring

### Ansible Automation
- Configuration management and deployment automation
- Handles post-provisioning setup and configuration
- Installs and configures Wazuh agents across the environment

## Purpose

This environment enables students to:
- Practice SOC analyst workflows in a safe, controlled lab
- Learn SIEM operations using Wazuh for log analysis and monitoring
- Understand threat detection and incident response
- Work with vulnerable environments (bytekingdom-light) for hands-on security testing
- Experience infrastructure automation with Terraform and Ansible

The entire setup is available on GitHub, making it easy for other educators to deploy similar training environments.
